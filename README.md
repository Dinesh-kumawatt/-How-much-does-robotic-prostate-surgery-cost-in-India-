Cost can vary a lot depending on the hospital and city. On average, robotic prostate surgery in India cost around ₹2.5 to ₹5 lakh. This include hospital stay, tests, medicines, and surgeon fees. Private hospitals with top robotic systems may charge more. It’s still cheaper compared to other countries like USA or UK. Insurance may cover some part, so better to check with hospital in advance. Also, cost is not just money—good care and results matter most.
